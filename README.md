Here is a school registration system that I have created:
I have defined the Student and Teacher classes in separate files, each containing properties and methods.
Then, I imported the Student and Teacher classes into a main file and created separate lists to hold the registered students and teachers. 
I also developed functions to add new students/teachers to the lists and to print out all the elements in the lists.
